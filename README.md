# AR-flares
This github repository contains codes related to solar flare prediction using SDO HMI active regions.  This code is related to the data described in the Dryad repository at `<insert link here>` and in the paper `<insert link here>`.

This repository contains code related to general manipulation of the SDO HMI dataset (`<insert link here.`) and the use of that for two machine learning problems for flare prediction: 1) a classical machine learning problem using extracted features of magnetic complexity and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier and 2) a deep learning problem using transfer learning on the VGG network.

## General code

## SVM Classification
Code for the SVM classifier is included in the `SVM` folder.
 - `BuidMasterFeatureSet_mp.py`

## VGG Classification
